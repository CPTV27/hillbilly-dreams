## [2026-03-21 — CC — WAITING_ON_AG

**Task:** hillbillydreamsinc.com — Parent brand site scaffolding + AG visual build spec

### What CC Did
1. Registered `hillbillydreamsinc.com` in Cloudflare (Chase purchased domain)
2. Added `hillbilly` brand to `packages/config/brands.ts` (id, domain, theme, nav linking to all child brands)
3. Added `getBrandFromHostname` match for `hillbillydreams`
4. Added middleware routing: `hillbillydreamsinc.com` → `/hillbilly` route
5. Created skeleton page at `apps/web/app/hillbilly/page.tsx` — functional but bare

### Files Changed
- Modified: `packages/config/brands.ts` — Added `hillbilly` BrandId + config + hostname resolver
- Modified: `apps/web/middleware.ts` — Added `/hillbilly` prefix, domain rewrite, dev brand entry
- Created: `apps/web/app/hillbilly/page.tsx` — Skeleton landing page with brand grid

### AG Assignment: Build the Hillbilly Dreams Visual Experience

This is the **parent brand** — the holding company page. It should feel like the front door to everything. Iron & Earth aesthetic. Not corporate. Not startup. A company page that looks like it was built by people who actually make things.

**What to build:**

1. **Hero section** — "Hillbilly Dreams Inc." with a one-liner and Chase's photography-style hero image (use Nano Banana with the photography style guide). Deep, warm, Southern. Night shot of the Inn or the river or Natchez skyline.

2. **Brand ecosystem** — Visual grid/wheel of all 7+ brands. Each card should feel alive — not just a link list. Show what each brand IS. Think magazine cover grid, not corporate subsidiary list.

3. **The Story** — Short "about" section. Who we are, why Natchez, what Outsider Economics means in practice. Use Chase's voice (see `user_voice_profile.md`). 2-3 paragraphs max.

4. **The Team** — Chase, Tracy, Amy/Arri. Minimal. Photos + one-liner roles. Not LinkedIn headshots — editorial portraits.

5. **Contact / Footer** — Natchez, MS. Email. Maybe the tagline: "Built with independence. Powered by stubbornness." or similar.

**Design constraints:**
- Dark background (#0a0f1a or similar), warm gold accent (#c8943e)
- Georgia/serif primary type, clean sans for UI
- Mobile-first — this will get texted to people
- NO stock photography. Nano Banana or Chase's real shots only.
- Theme class: `theme-hillbilly` — needs CSS tokens in `packages/config/tokens.css`

**Cloudflare DNS:**
- Domain is registered on Cloudflare already
- Needs CNAME or A record pointed at the Firebase App Hosting domain
- Chase will configure DNS in Cloudflare dashboard, or AG can spec the exact records needed

### Dependencies
- AG: Needs Nano Banana for hero/brand imagery
- AG: Needs to create `theme-hillbilly` tokens in `packages/config/tokens.css`
- Chase: DNS records in Cloudflare dashboard pointing to Firebase App Hosting

### Next
- AG: Build the full visual experience on the skeleton at `/hillbilly/page.tsx`
- CC: Will handle Cloudflare DNS → Firebase once AG confirms the page is ready to deploy

**Status:** WAITING_ON_AG

## [2026-03-21] — CC — COMPLETE

**Task:** BuyCurious Art artist application backend wired to PostgreSQL

### What Was Done
Added `ArtistApplication` Prisma model and POST `/api/gallery/applications` route. The `/gallery/apply` form now saves to the database instead of `console.log`.

### Files Changed
- Modified: `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma` — Added ArtistApplication model
- Created: `apps/web/app/api/gallery/applications/route.ts` — POST handler with validation
- Modified: `apps/web/app/gallery/apply/page.tsx` — Form submission wired to API

**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## [2026-03-20 22:20] — CC — COMPLETE

**Task:** BuyCurious Art gallery rebuild — fix broken page, add wall art, deploy

### What Was Done
1. **Fixed gallery CSS completely broken** — `.next` cache was corrupted, serving a 500 error for CSS bundle. All styles (`.bm-nav`, `.btn`, `.theme-gallery`, `:root` tokens) were missing. Nav rendered as bullet list, buttons as plain links. Fix: cleared `.next` cache, restarted dev server.
2. **Created dual-mode gallery theme** — `.theme-gallery` (clean white museum: `--bg: #fafaf8`, `--text: #1a1a1a`) and `.theme-gallery-funky` (aristo-boho maximalism: deep purple, neon pink/cyan/lime) in `tokens.css`
3. **Replaced landscape/building hero images with wall art** — Generated AI art pieces matching each fictional artist's medium: oil painting, mixed media collage, B&W blues photo, ceramic vessel, textile quilt, abstract expressionist
4. **Integrated Chase's Lightroom photos** — Converted 7 exports from `~/Downloads/lightroom photos/` to WebP. Artist portrait with paintings (hero), aristo-boho parlor shot, landscapes as fine art prints, B&W EQ at window
5. **Deployed to production** — `git push origin main` → Firebase App Hosting build triggered
6. **Set up production monitoring** — Scheduled task `bmt-site-monitor` checks 6 routes every 10 minutes

### Files Changed
- Modified: `packages/config/tokens.css` — Added `.theme-gallery` and `.theme-gallery-funky` class themes
- Modified: `apps/web/app/gallery/layout.tsx` — Theme wrapper with `id="gallery-theme-root"`
- Modified: `apps/web/app/gallery/page.tsx` — Full rewrite: dual-mode, art images, funky toggle
- Modified: `apps/web/app/gallery/GalleryNav.tsx` — Theme-aware nav background
- Modified: `apps/web/app/gallery/demo-data.ts` — Andrea Brooks flagship artist
- Created: `apps/web/public/images/gallery/` — 15 art images (AI generated + Chase Lightroom exports)
- Created: `apps/web/app/global-error.tsx` — Error boundary

### Production Status
- ✅ bigmuddytouring.com — All routes 200 (root, /touring/inn, /gallery, /admin/login)
- ❌ buycurious.art — **525 SSL handshake failed** (Cloudflare Pages SSL config issue)
- ⚠️ Google OAuth — Redirect URI `https://bigmuddytouring.com/api/auth/callback/google` needs to be added in Google Cloud Console by Chase

### AG Pickup Items
1. **buycurious.art SSL** — Fix Cloudflare Pages SSL config (525 error)
2. **Gallery visual polish** — Fix hydration warning in GalleryNav.tsx `<style>` tag, mobile responsive tuning, funky mode animation refinement
3. **Brand-unique themes** — `.theme-radio`, `.theme-magazine`, `.theme-records`, `.theme-studio` need distinct visual identities
4. **Metaphor images** — Chase wants "more analog" aesthetic, endpoint should show Google Chat thread not generic chat bubble

**Dependencies:** Chase must add OAuth redirect URI in Google Cloud Console
**Next:** AG picks up visual polish + brand themes, CC available for backend/infra
**Status:** COMPLETE

## [2026-03-20 18:30] — CC — COMPLETE

**Task:** Fix AG field mismatch in DealRoomMode pricing tiers

### Issue Found
AG's dynamic pricing code read `liveData.licensingEconomics.baseLicenseTier` — a field path that doesn't exist in CC's `DealDataRevenue` payload. The actual path is `liveData.licensing.baseLicenseFee` and `liveData.licensing.techOpsFee`. The `|| 134000` fallback prevented a crash but meant pricing always showed fallback numbers, never live data.

### Fix Applied
- Changed field paths to match CC's typed payload: `liveData.licensing.baseLicenseFee`, `liveData.licensing.techOpsFee`, `liveData.licensing.royaltyRate`
- Revenue Share Yr1 now also reads live royalty rate instead of hardcoded `'5%'`
- Monthly calculations simplified: `baseLicenseFee / 12` and `techOpsFee / 12` directly

### Files Changed
- Modified: `/Users/chasethis/S2PX/client/src/components/deal-arena/DealRoomMode.tsx` — Lines 197-206

### Lesson
This is exactly why the typed payload matters. AG built to a guessed field name, CC built with explicit types. The ledger caught the gap. Going forward: AG should import or reference `DealDataRevenue` type from `shared/types/deal-data.ts`.

**Status:** COMPLETE

## [2026-03-20 18:15] — AG — COMPLETE

**Task:** Wire Morning Printout webhook + Dynamic Owen pricing tiers

### What AG Did
1. Appended a Google Chat webhook push to `/api/deal-data/snapshot` — formats the live snapshot into a `☕ Morning Operation Printout` string and POSTs to `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL`
2. Moved `PRICING_TIERS` from static `const` into `DealRoomMode` component state, dynamically scaling Software License and Operations monthly costs from `liveData.licensingEconomics.baseLicenseTier` (field path corrected by CC above)

### Files Changed
- Modified: `/Users/chasethis/S2PX/server/routes/deal-data.ts`
- Modified: `/Users/chasethis/S2PX/client/src/components/deal-arena/DealRoomMode.tsx`

**Status:** COMPLETE (field path fix applied by CC)

## [2026-03-20 18:00] — AG — COMPLETE

**Task:** Wire Live Financial Pipeline into Deal Room AI Concierge

### What AG Did
Edited `/Users/chasethis/S2PX/client/src/components/deal-arena/DealRoomMode.tsx`:
1. Added `useState<any>(null)` for `liveData`
2. Added `useEffect` that fetches `/api/deal-data/revenue` on mount (with auth Bearer token from localStorage)
3. Injects the full JSON payload into the AI's `DEAL_KNOWLEDGE` system prompt as `CRITICAL LIVE SYSTEMS DATA`
4. Gemini now has real-time revenue, margin, pipeline, and licensing economics when answering Owen's questions

### Integration Chain (Now Complete)
```
QuickBooks → OAuth Sync → qbo_* tables
                              ↓
                    /api/deal-data/revenue (CC built)
                              ↓
                    DealRoomMode.tsx useEffect fetch (AG wired)
                              ↓
                    DEAL_KNOWLEDGE + JSON.stringify(liveData)
                              ↓
                    /api/ai/chat (Gemini with systemOverride)
                              ↓
                    Owen asks "Where did $1.12M come from?"
                    AI answers with LIVE trailing 12mo revenue
```

### Files Changed
- Modified: `/Users/chasethis/S2PX/client/src/components/deal-arena/DealRoomMode.tsx` — Lines 67-78, 100

**Status:** COMPLETE

## [2026-03-20 17:45] — CC — COMPLETE

**Task:** Agent 6 — QuickBooks Revenue API (Live Financial Pipeline)

### What Was Built
Replaced the hardcoded stub at `/api/deal-data/revenue` with a full live financial pipeline that pulls from 7 QBO synced database tables + the scoping forms deal pipeline. Zero hardcoded numbers. Zero simulated data.

### Three Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Consumers |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `GET /api/deal-data/revenue` | Master payload — revenue, margin, pipeline, licensing economics, 24-month trend | DealCalculator, executive dashboards, Owen presentation |
| `GET /api/deal-data/licensing-calc?revenue=N` | Lightweight licensing math for slider interactions | DealCalculator component |
| `GET /api/deal-data/snapshot` | Flat key-value headline numbers | Google Chat bot, Tracy Morning Printouts, AG dashboards |

### Architecture
- **8 parallel SQL queries** against QBO synced tables (qbo_sales_transactions, qbo_pnl_monthly) + scoping_forms
- **5-minute in-memory cache** with `?refresh=true` bypass
- **Graceful fallback**: if DB errors, serves stale cache with `dataSource: 'fallback'`
- **Role-gated**: developer, admin, ceo only
- **Licensing constants**: $24K base + $54K ops + 5% royalty (from S2PX Licensing Proposal)

### Data Flow
```
QuickBooks → OAuth Sync → qbo_* tables → /api/deal-data/revenue → JSON
                                                                    ├── DealCalculator (replaces $1.12M hardcode)
                                                                    ├── Executive Dashboard
                                                                    ├── Google Chat Bot (Big Muddy Command)
                                                                    ├── Tracy Morning Printouts (AG)
                                                                    └── Owen Deal Presentation
```

### Files Changed
- Replaced: `/Users/chasethis/S2PX/server/routes/deal-data.ts` — Full rewrite from 93-line stub to 290-line live pipeline
- Created: `/Users/chasethis/S2PX/shared/types/deal-data.ts` — 85 lines, typed interfaces for all payloads
- Already registered in `/Users/chasethis/S2PX/server/routes.ts` at line 99

### Dependencies
- QBO tables must be populated (existing sync pipeline handles this)
- Scoping forms with `estimated_budget` and `probability` for weighted pipeline

### Next
- AG: Wire `/api/deal-data/snapshot` into Google Chat bot for live financial context
- AG: Build Tracy Morning Printout generator consuming `/api/deal-data/revenue`
- CC: Update DealCalculator component to fetch from `/api/deal-data/revenue` instead of hardcoded `useState(1120000)`
- CC: Wire Owen Deal Presentation to use live licensing economics

**Status:** COMPLETE

## [2026-03-20 17:15] — CC — WAITING_ON_AG

**Task:** Marketing Metaphor Images — Creative Direction Feedback from Chase

### Images Staged
Copied AG's 3 metaphor prototypes into project:
- `/apps/web/public/images/marketing/metaphor_the_prism_1774057148975.png`
- `/apps/web/public/images/marketing/metaphor_the_control_room_1774057160854.png`
- `/apps/web/public/images/marketing/metaphor_the_weaver_1774057174937.png`

### Chase's Art Direction (CRITICAL — AG READ THIS)

**1. "More analog."**
Current renders are too clean/digital/tech. Big Muddy brand is Iron & Earth — grain, warmth, hand-feel, road-worn texture. The chaos side is fine. But the resolution/output side needs to feel physical, not Silicon Valley sleek. Think: weathered wood desk, printed page, handwritten margin note, analog warmth. NOT: floating holographic UI, glass surfaces, neon glow.

**2. "The endpoint is a Google Chat thread where you see the context of a conversation."**
The visual payoff at the end of each metaphor (the clean chat bubble, the phone screen, the golden thread → notification) needs to be replaced with a **real Google Chat thread**. That's the actual product. Big Muddy Command lives inside Google Chat. The viewer should see a conversational thread — messages flowing, context visible, the AI responding naturally inside Google Workspace. Show the Google Chat UI. That's the dogfood. That's the pitch.

### What AG Needs to Do
- Regenerate all 3 metaphor images with:
  - More analog/physical textures (especially on the "resolution" side)
  - Replace generic chat bubble / phone screen endpoint with a recognizable Google Chat thread UI
  - Keep the chaos→clarity narrative structure
  - Keep the brand feel: Southern, warm, earned (not corporate)
- Drop updated versions to same artifact directory or directly to `/apps/web/public/images/marketing/`

**Files Changed:** Created `/apps/web/public/images/marketing/` directory with 3 prototype images
**Dependencies:** AG needs to regenerate with updated creative direction
**Next:** AG regenerates, CC drops into marketing deck
**Status:** WAITING_ON_AG

## [2026-03-20 16:30] — CC — WAITING_ON_AG

**Task:** BCA (BuyCurious Art) Platform Launch — Andrea Brooks / A Bold Collab as Flagship Artist

### Context
Chase wants BCA to be an art marketplace platform. "A Bold Collab" (Andrea Brooks, Fayetteville AR) is the first artist/vendor. Andrea designed the Big Muddy Inn, has a book coming out April 2026, and was featured in *At Home in Arkansas* for her "aristo-boho" aesthetic. First collaborative project: a book about the art in the Big Muddy Inn (cross-brand collab between Magazine, Gallery, and Inn).

### CC Completed
1. Added Andrea Brooks as featured artist in `/apps/web/app/gallery/demo-data.ts` (id: `a0`, slug: `andrea-brooks`)
2. Added 2 artworks: "The Blues Room — Original Commission" (site-specific installation) and "Aristo-Boho Collection I — Parlor Series" ($4,500 curated collection)
3. CRS-format Tracy briefing updated with BCA in revenue model
4. Operating Agreement updated with IP protection clause (Article V-A)
5. Full Tracy transition plan: 30-day exit from Inn duties, new role as Editor-in-Chief & Radio Station Manager

### AG Assignment: Build the BCA Visual Experience
The gallery storefront exists at `/apps/web/app/gallery/` with pages, demo data, and API routes. AG needs to:

1. **Fix routing** — Gallery may not be accessible from the main touring domain. Check middleware routing for `buycuriousart.com` → `/gallery` rewrite. Test at `localhost:3000/gallery`
2. **Artist storefront for Andrea** — `/gallery/artists/andrea-brooks` needs to be a showcase, not just a listing. This is the flagship store. Show her work, her bio, her book launch, link to A Bold Collab
3. **Real images** — Currently using color placeholders. Need real images of the Inn's interior (from GCS: `bmt-media-bigmuddy` bucket) for Andrea's artwork entries
4. **Build `/gallery/apply` page** — Artist application form for new sellers
5. **Build `/gallery/about` page** — About BCA, the mission, how it connects to the Big Muddy ecosystem
6. **Stripe Connect prep** — Marketplace payments architecture. Each artist is a Stripe Connected Account. BCA takes commission.
7. **Inn Art Book concept page** — A landing page or section promoting the upcoming Big Muddy Inn art book collab (Magazine × Gallery × Inn)

### Brand Config
- id: `gallery`, domain: `buycuriousart.com`, theme: `theme-touring`, accent: `#c8943e`
- Nav: Gallery, Artists, About

### Integration Points
- Demo data at `/apps/web/app/gallery/demo-data.ts` — Andrea is `a0`, works are `w0a`, `w0b`
- API routes at `/apps/web/app/api/gallery/artists/route.ts` and `/artworks/route.ts`
- Prisma schema has no gallery-specific models yet — currently demo data only

### Files Changed:
- Modified: `/apps/web/app/gallery/demo-data.ts` — Added Andrea Brooks + 2 artworks
- Modified: `/Users/chasethis/bmt/AGENT_LEDGER.md` — This entry

### Dependencies:
- AG: Needs access to GCS bucket `bmt-media-bigmuddy` for real Inn photos
- AG: May need Andrea's actual portfolio images (Chase to provide)
- CC: Will build Prisma models for Gallery when AG is ready for DB-backed data

### Next:
- AG: Pick up visual build — storefront, Andrea's page, apply form, about page
- CC: Build Prisma schema for Gallery (Artist, Artwork, Collection models)
- CC: Wire Stripe Connect for marketplace payments
- Future: Andrea's book launch page, Inn art book collab landing

**Status:** WAITING_ON_AG

- Created: `/scripts/seed-natchez-contacts.ts` — 7 contact seed data
- Modified: `/apps/web/app/media/page.tsx` — Full splash page redesign (in progress)

### Dependencies:
- Seed scripts need `DATABASE_URL` set and `npx tsx scripts/seed-natchez-businesses.ts` run
- Schema changes need `prisma migrate dev` to apply to database
- Delta Dawn upgrade needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for claude-sonnet-4-20250514

### Next:
- AG: Build Three.js/React visualizations for the ecosystem flywheel and talent pipeline
